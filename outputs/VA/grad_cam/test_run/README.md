## Grad-CAM

**Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** is a technique used to visualize the regions of an image that a CNN focuses on when making predictions.

Running the code will generate Grad-CAM images for each test image.

Output directory:

```
./outputs/<task>/grad_cam/<condition>/
```

The generated images overlay a heatmap on the original image to highlight important regions.

**Note:** Grad-CAM images are not included in this repository due to patient data privacy and security considerations.
